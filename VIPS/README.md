# [VIP] Test
My Discord server - https://discord.com/invite/g798xERK5Y

Allows you to view the list of VIP players using the command !vips
There is a setting of display type (with or without group)

In **vip.phrases.txt** add:
```
	"VIPS_Title"
	{
		"en"	"VIP players:"
		"ru"	"Вип игроки:"
	}
	"VIPS_NoPlayers"
	{
		"en"	"No VIP players found"
		"ru"	"Не найдено ни одного вип игрока"
	}
	"VIPS_Player"
	{
		"en"	"%s (%s)"
		"ru"	"%s (%s)"
	}
	"VIPS_Player2"
	{
		"en"	"%s"
		"ru"	"%s"
	}
```
